ABSTRACT
--------

The proliferation of digital services has led to an unprecedented 
fragmentation of user identity across disparate platforms, each maintaining 
partial, often conflicting, and siloed representations of the same individual. 
Current approaches to digital identity management—including centralized 
Identity Providers (IdPs), federated systems (OAuth, SAML), and emerging 
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) frameworks—address authentication and 
authorization but fail to tackle the fundamental problem: identity is treated 
as a static set of credentials rather than a dynamic, evolving entity.

This project proposes the design and implementation of a Unified Identity 
Graph System (UIGS), a novel framework that models digital identity as a 
time-evolving, privacy-preserving knowledge graph. Unlike existing SSI wallets 
that merely store Verifiable Credentials (VCs), UIGS reasons over fragmented 
identity artifacts to:

  (1) Ingest heterogeneous identity signals from multiple sources (social 
      logins, government credentials, blockchain DIDs, manual attestations).
      
  (2) Decompose credentials into atomic claims represented as graph nodes 
      with temporal edges, enabling historical querying and evolution tracking.
      
  (3) Detect and represent conflicts as first-class entities within the graph, 
      rather than treating conflicting data as verification failures.
      
  (4) Perform user-controlled probabilistic identity resolution using 
      graph-based algorithms, placing agency in the hands of the individual.
      
  (5) Support selective disclosure via zero-knowledge-compatible proof 
      mechanisms, ensuring privacy-by-design.

The system is grounded in a comprehensive literature survey spanning 25 
academic papers (2020-2025) across eight thematic areas: identity management 
evolution, SSI/DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, trust models, zero-knowledge 
proofs, graph-based identity representation, identity resolution, and 
regulatory compliance (GDPR/eIDAS).

The proposed architecture employs a microservices-based design with:
  - A high-throughput Ingestion Service (Go) for credential intake.
  - A Graph Reasoning Engine (Python/Neo4j) for knowledge representation 
    and link prediction.
  - A User Dashboard (Next.js) for visualization and identity management.

This work contributes to the field by addressing five identified research gaps:
  (1) Lack of identity continuity models
  (2) Absence of user-centric identity unification
  (3) No computational representation of identity conflicts
  (4) Corporate control over identity resolution
  (5) Domain-specific rather than cross-domain identity graphs

The outcome is a production-ready system that empowers users to own, visualize, 
and reason about their fragmented digital selves.
