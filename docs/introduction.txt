                    DIGITAL IDENTITY FRAGMENTATION

1. PROBLEM CONTEXT
================================================================================

1.1 The Fragmentation Crisis
----------------------------

In the modern digital landscape, an average individual interacts with over 
100 online services, each requiring some form of identity verification. These 
services span:

  - Social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X)
  - Financial services (Banks, Payment apps, Cryptocurrency exchanges)
  - Government portals (Tax, Healthcare, Voting systems)
  - Professional systems (Email, Enterprise SSO, HR platforms)
  - E-commerce (Amazon, local retailers, subscription services)

Each of these services creates and maintains its own representation of the 
user's identity. This leads to IDENTITY FRAGMENTATION: the scattering of a 
user's identity across dozens of disconnected silos.

Visual Representation of the Problem:

    +-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
    |  Service A  |     |  Service B  |     |  Service C  |
    |  (Bank)     |     |  (Social)   |     |  (Govt)     |
    +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+
           |                   |                   |
           v                   v                   v
    +-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
    | Email: X  |       | Email: Y  |       | Aadhaar # |
    | Phone: P1 |       | Username  |       | Name (Off)|
    | DOB: D1   |       | Alt Phone |       | DOB: D2   |
    +-----------+       +-----------+       +-----------+
           \                   |                  /
            \                  |                 /
             +--------> [THE SAME PERSON] <-----+
                    (But no system knows this)

Consequences of Fragmentation:
  - INCONSISTENCY: Same person has different data across services.
  - VULNERABILITY: Attack surface multiplied by number of accounts.
  - BURDEN: Users cannot see or manage their own digital footprint.
  - LOSS: Account deletion destroys identity history irreversibly.
  - NO CONTINUITY: Identity cannot be proven across time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 Why Existing Solutions Fail
-------------------------------

(A) Centralized Identity Providers (Google Sign-In, Aadhaar, National IDs)
    Problem: Replace fragmentation with CENTRAL DEPENDENCY.
    - Revocable by provider (account suspension = identity death).
    - Subject to jurisdiction (cross-border portability fails).
    - Focus on AUTHENTICATION, not IDENTITY MODELING.

(B) Federated Identity (SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect)
    Problem: Designed for enterprise SSO, not personal identity sovereignty.
    - Still relies on IdP trust (if IdP fails, access fails).
    - Federation agreements are institution-to-institution.
    - User has no control over what attributes are shared.

(C) Self-Sovereign Identity / Blockchain DIDs (Sovrin, uPort, ION)
    Problem: Treats identity as a COLLECTION OF CREDENTIALS, not an entity.
    - Wallets are "credential dumps"; no reasoning capability.
    - Assumes a single root DID; ignores identity evolution.
    - Credential validity is point-in-time; no temporal continuity.

(D) Data Portability (GDPR Article 20 exports)
    Problem: Provides data, not semantics.
    - Exports are flat JSON/CSV; no relationships preserved.
    - No mechanism to import into another system meaningfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 The Core Research Question
------------------------------

Given the failure of existing paradigms, this project asks:

  +======================================================================+
  |  How can we represent digital identity as a time-evolving,          |
  |  privacy-preserving, user-controlled graph of claims, credentials,  |
  |  and contexts that can be reasoned about, queried, and selectively  |
  |  disclosed across any domain?                                       |
  +======================================================================+

This question has not been adequately addressed in the academic literature 
(see Literature Survey). The closest works are:
  - Graph-based persona modeling (Gupta et al., KDD 2025) - single domain.
  - SSI wallet systems (Sovrin, BDIMS) - no reasoning.
  - Identity resolution algorithms - backend, not user-facing.

================================================================================
2. PROPOSED SOLUTION: UNIFIED IDENTITY GRAPH SYSTEM (UIGS)
================================================================================

2.1 Core Concept
----------------

UIGS treats identity not as a record, but as a GRAPH:

  - NODES represent atomic identity elements:
      + Identity Fragments (accounts, logins)
      + Claims (assertions like "DOB = 1990-01-15")
      + Credentials (signed VCs from issuers)
      + Contexts (roles like "Employee at X", "Student at Y")

  - EDGES represent relationships:
      + SUPPORTS (Credential C supports Claim X)
      + CONTRADICTS (Claim X conflicts with Claim Y)
      + DERIVED_FROM (Claim X derived from Credential C)
      + TEMPORAL_SUCCESSOR (Claim X' replaces Claim X after date D)
      + LIKELY_SAME (Probabilistic link: Fragment A ~ Fragment B)

ASCII Representation of an Identity Graph:

    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    |  Fragment: Gmail  |          |  Fragment: GitHub |
    | (email@gmail.com) |          |  (username: xyz)  |
    +---------+---------+          +---------+---------+
              |                              |
              | SUPPORTS                     | SUPPORTS
              v                              v
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    | Claim: Email =    |<---------| Claim: Email =    |
    | email@gmail.com   |  SAME    | email@gmail.com   |
    +---------+---------+          +-------------------+
              |
              | DERIVED_FROM
              v
    +-------------------+
    | Credential: Google|
    | (OIDC Token)      |
    +-------------------+
              |
              | CONTRADICTS (DOB mismatch)
              v
    +-------------------+
    | Credential: Bank  |
    | (KYC Document)    |
    +-------------------+

2.2 System Capabilities
-----------------------

  (1) INGESTION: Accept identity signals from any source.
        - OIDC tokens (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
        - W3C Verifiable Credentials (JSON-LD format)
        - Manual attestations (user-provided data)
        - Simulated government APIs (for demo)

  (2) DECOMPOSITION: Break credentials into atomic claims.
        - Input: VC asserting {name: "X", DOB: "1990-01-15", degree: "CS"}
        - Output: Three Claim nodes, linked to one Credential node.

  (3) LINKING: Probabilistic connection of fragments.
        - Algorithm: Jaccard similarity on shared attributes.
        - Edges created with confidence scores (0.0 - 1.0).
        - User can CONFIRM or REJECT suggested links.

  (4) CONFLICT DETECTION: Model disagreement, not failure.
        - Example: Two VCs show different DOB.
        - System creates CONTRADICTS edge, does not discard either.
        - User decides which to prefer in a given context.

  (5) TEMPORAL QUERY: Ask about identity at any point in time.
        - "What was my email on 2020-01-01?"
        - "When did my address change from X to Y?"

  (6) SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE: ZKP-compatible proof generation.
        - Prove "I am over 21" without revealing DOB.
        - Prove "I hold a valid degree from University X" without
          revealing the degree name.

5. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Digital identity fragmentation is not merely an inconvenience—it is a 
structural failure of the internet's identity layer. The current ecosystem 
forces users to surrender control to platforms, accept inconsistencies across 
services, and lose their digital history when accounts are terminated.

This project proposes a paradigm shift: identity as a USER-OWNED, TIME-
EVOLVING GRAPH that can be reasoned about, visualized, and selectively 
disclosed. By synthesizing insights from SSI, knowledge graphs, identity 
resolution, and privacy-preserving cryptography, the Unified Identity Graph 
System (UIGS) represents a novel contribution to both academic research and 
practical identity management.

The following documents (SRS, Architecture, Phase Plan) detail the formal 
requirements, technical design, and implementation roadmap.
