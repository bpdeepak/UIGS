1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Digital identity management has evolved from isolated, siloed systems to 
interconnected federated models, and more recently to user-centric, self-
sovereign paradigms. However, despite these advancements, the fundamental 
problem of IDENTITY FRAGMENTATION persists. Users maintain dozens of digital 
identities across platforms, each containing partial, often conflicting 
information, with no coherent mechanism to unify or reason about them.

This survey examines 25+ academic papers spanning 2020-2025 to understand:
  (1) The current state of digital identity research
  (2) Gaps in existing solutions
  (3) Opportunities for novel contributions

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 THEME A: EVOLUTION OF IDENTITY MANAGEMENT PARADIGMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This theme traces the historical development from Isolated -> Centralized -> 
Federated -> User-Centric -> Self-Sovereign Identity models.

Key Protocols in Evolution:
  - LDAP (1990s): Early directory-based identity storage.
  - SAML 2.0 (2005): XML-based enterprise SSO.
  - OAuth 2.0 (2012): Authorization framework for API access.
  - OpenID Connect (2014): Identity layer over OAuth 2.0.
  - DIDs/VCs (2019-): W3C standards for decentralized identity.

Papers in this theme analyze the tradeoffs between centralized convenience 
and decentralized user control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 THEME B: SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY (SSI) AND DECENTRALIZED IDENTIFIERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SSI represents the most recent paradigm where users hold their credentials in 
a "digital wallet" and selectively disclose information without relying on a 
central authority.

Core W3C Standards:
  - DID Core (W3C Recommendation, 2022)
  - Verifiable Credentials Data Model (W3C, 2022)

Key Frameworks Analyzed:
  +------------------+--------------------+----------------------------------+
  |  Framework       |  Blockchain        |  Key Feature                     |
  +------------------+--------------------+----------------------------------+
  |  Sovrin          |  Hyperledger Indy  |  Permissioned, enterprise-ready  |
  |  uPort / Veramo  |  Ethereum          |  ERC-725 identity standard       |
  |  ION             |  Bitcoin (Sidetree)|  Scalable DID anchoring          |
  |  KILT            |  Substrate         |  Credential delegation           |
  +------------------+--------------------+----------------------------------+

Limitation Identified: All SSI frameworks treat identity as a SET OF 
CREDENTIALS, not as an EVOLVING ENTITY. They answer "Is this credential valid?" 
but not "How did this identity evolve over time?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 THEME C: VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS AND STANDARDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are the digital equivalent of physical documents 
(passports, diplomas, licenses). They are cryptographically signed claims.

VC Lifecycle:
  +----------+       +--------+       +----------+
  |  ISSUER  | ----> | HOLDER | ----> | VERIFIER |
  +----------+       +--------+       +----------+
       |                  |                 |
       v                  v                 v
   Signs claim      Stores in wallet   Validates sig.

Key Papers:
  - Mazzocca et al. (2024): Comprehensive DID/VC survey.
  - Le et al. (2025): BDIMS - AI-based VC extraction with Merkle trees.

Limitation Identified: VCs are static "snapshots." A VC issued in 2020 says 
nothing about the holder's state in 2024. There is no mechanism for 
TEMPORAL CONTINUITY.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 THEME D: TRUST AND THREAT MODELS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This theme formalizes the security assumptions and attack vectors in 
decentralized identity systems.

Trust Framework (ToIP - Trust over IP):
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Layer 4: Application Ecosystems (Governance)                |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Layer 3: Data Exchange Protocols (Issue, Present, Verify)   |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Layer 2: Peer-to-Peer Communication (DIDComm)               |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Layer 1: Public Utilities (Blockchain/DLT)                  |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+

Key Threats Identified in Literature:
  - Phishing/Social Engineering (Targeting Holders)
  - Credential Theft (Wallet Compromise)
  - Issuer Impersonation
  - Correlation Attacks (Linking multiple VCs to deanonymize)
  - Replay Attacks (Reusing old proofs)

Limitation: Trust models are COMPONENT-WISE (Issuer, Holder, Verifier), not 
IDENTITY-WISE (treating the person's holistic identity as the subject of 
threat modeling).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 THEME E: PRIVACY-PRESERVING TECHNIQUES (ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) allow a prover to demonstrate truth of a statement 
without revealing the underlying data.

Example Use Case:
  "I am over 21 years old."
  - Traditional: Show Birthdate (Discloses exact DOB)
  - ZKP: Prove (Current_Date - DOB) > 21 years (Reveals nothing else)

ZKP Schemes Used in Identity:
  +---------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
  |  Scheme       |  Type                       |  Use in Identity          |
  +---------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+
  |  zk-SNARKs    |  Non-Interactive, Succinct  |  Age/Attribute Proofs     |
  |  zk-STARKs    |  Post-Quantum Safe          |  Future-Proofing          |
  |  BBS+         |  Signature Scheme           |  Selective Disclosure VCs |
  |  CL-Signatures|  Camenisch-Lysyanskaya      |  Hyperledger Indy (AnonCreds)|
  +---------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+

Limitation: ZKPs solve DISCLOSURE MINIMIZATION at a point in time, but do not 
address IDENTITY CONTINUITY (proving the same person holds credentials across 
time without linking).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 THEME F: GRAPH-BASED IDENTITY REPRESENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This theme is MOST RELEVANT to the proposed project. It explores representing 
identity not as flat records, but as connected graphs.

Key Concepts:
  - Identity Graph: Connects user identifiers (emails, phone numbers, device IDs)
    to build a unified profile.
  - Knowledge Graph: Stores semantic relationships (Subject-Predicate-Object).

Industry Use Cases:
  - Marketing: LiveRamp, Oracle Data Cloud (Customer Identity Graphs)
  - Fraud Detection: TigerGraph, Neo4j Identity Graph solutions.

Academic Contributions:
  - Gupta et al. (KDD 2025): TriPer - Tripartite Graph for Persona Identification.
    Models users as connected to multiple personas (abstract "roles").
    Uses Graph Neural Networks for inference.

Limitation: Industry graphs focus on CORPORATE USE (tracking users for ads). 
Academic graphs focus on SINGLE DOMAIN (e.g., social media). No system models 
a USER-CENTRIC, CROSS-DOMAIN, TIME-EVOLVING identity graph.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7 THEME G: IDENTITY RESOLUTION AND ENTITY MATCHING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identity Resolution is the process of determining if two records refer to the 
same real-world entity.

Approaches:
  - Deterministic: Exact match on unique IDs (SSN, Email).
  - Probabilistic (Fellegi-Sunter Model): Calculates match probability based 
    on field agreement/disagreement patterns.
  - Machine Learning: Supervised classifiers trained on labeled match/non-match 
    pairs.
  - LLM-Based: Recent research uses Large Language Models for semantic matching.

Key Formula (Fellegi-Sunter Match Weight):

  W = log2 [ P(field agrees | match) / P(field agrees | non-match) ]

  If W > threshold_upper => MATCH
  If W < threshold_lower => NON-MATCH
  Otherwise => UNCERTAIN

Limitation: These techniques are designed for BACKEND DATA INTEGRATION, not 
USER-FACING IDENTITY MANAGEMENT. They assume a trusted party performs the 
resolution. Our project aims to give the USER control over this process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.8 THEME H: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Regulations:
  - GDPR (EU, 2018): Right to be Forgotten, Data Minimization, Consent.
  - eIDAS 2.0 (EU, 2024): European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI)
  - CCPA (California, 2020): Consumer privacy rights.

Challenges in Blockchain-based SSI:
  - GDPR Article 17 (Erasure) vs. Blockchain Immutability.
    Solution: Store only HASHES/PROOFS on-chain; data off-chain in user wallet.
  - Accountability: Who is the "Data Controller" in a decentralized system?

5. RESEARCH GAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

After analyzing the literature, the following critical gaps emerge:

+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP ID                 |  DESCRIPTION                                    |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP-01: No Continuity  |  Existing SSI systems treat identity as static  |
|                         |  credentials. No model for identity EVOLUTION   |
|                         |  (how credentials derive from earlier ones).    |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP-02: No Unification |  Users have 50+ accounts. No system allows them |
|                         |  to BUILD A UNIFIED VIEW without central       |
|                         |  authority (like a personal identity graph).    |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP-03: No Conflict    |  If two credentials have conflicting data       |
|  Representation         |  (different DOBs), current systems fail. No     |
|                         |  system MODELS CONFLICT as a first-class entity.|
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP-04: User Not in    |  Identity resolution algorithms are backend     |
|  Control                |  processes run by companies. Users have no      |
|                         |  agency to perform or contest resolution.       |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
|  GAP-05: No Cross-Domain|  Graphs are domain-specific (marketing, fraud). |
|  Graph                  |  No unified identity graph spans social, work,  |
|                         |  government, and financial domains.             |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

================================================================================
6. SYNTHESIS AND PROPOSED NOVELTY
================================================================================

Based on the gap analysis, this project proposes the following novel 
contribution:

+========================================================================+
|  PROPOSED SYSTEM: Unified Identity Graph System (UIGS)                 |
+========================================================================+
|  Core Innovation:                                                      |
|    Model identity as a TIME-EVOLVING, PRIVACY-PRESERVING, USER-        |
|    CONTROLLED knowledge graph that:                                    |
|      (a) Ingests fragmented credentials from multiple sources.         |
|      (b) Represents claims as atomic nodes with temporal edges.        |
|      (c) Detects and models conflicts (not fails on them).             |
|      (d) Performs probabilistic identity resolution under USER control.|
|      (e) Supports selective disclosure via ZKP-compatible proofs.      |
+========================================================================+

How It Differs From Existing Work:
  - vs. SSI Wallets (Sovrin, uPort): Wallets store VCs; UIGS REASONS over VCs.
  - vs. Marketing Graph (LiveRamp): Corporate-controlled; UIGS is USER-owned.
  - vs. TriPer (Gupta): Single-domain (e-commerce); UIGS is CROSS-DOMAIN.
  - vs. BDIMS (Le): Focus on VC issuance; UIGS focus on VC UNIFICATION.
